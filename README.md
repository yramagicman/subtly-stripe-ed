==============

This is a WordPress boilerplate theme developed as a starting point for other themes. This starter theme is a mashup of the [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) and [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/) starter themes. Many functions found in functions.php and in the inc folder are almost direct copies of functions from those themes. I've only modified them to fit my coding style and HTML. 

I've taken the cleanup functions from Bones and the custom header, jetpack, and WordPress.com functions from Underscores and mashed them into one starter theme.
